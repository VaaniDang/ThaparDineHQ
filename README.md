# ThaparDineHQ
The ThaparDineHQ is a digital platform designed to address the current challenge faced by students in accessing menus from various eateries around the campus. TDHQ will provide a centralized solution for viewing, accessing, and comparing menus from different eateries on campus, making it convenient for students to make informed dining choices. It will also help to avoid the time-consuming and inefficient process for accessing restaurant information. The reviews section will help students decide better.
